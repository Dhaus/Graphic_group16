For this project, will we be animating aspects of Aparna's picture from Assignment 1. The image depicts a beach scene with an ocean, a sun, and an island with a palm tree. For our animation, the scene will shift through night and day. As the day progresses, the sun will move across the screen. At night time, the moon will emerge and also progress across the screen. The sky will also change colors to indicate the time progression. There will also be a few aquatic animals moving in the ocean. These sequences will progress infinitely.

To create the animations, a "celestial bodies" bodies class will be created. Under this category fall the sun and moon subclasses. Both of these class objects have similar characteristics - they move across the window, they are circles, and have a fixed color. The differ in size and color. Thus far, Aparna has created the celestial bodies, sun, and moon classes. Daniel Choi and Daniel Hauser will work on the other objects, which include a human, a shark, and a fish. We will work on these classes separately and reconvene to ensure that all classes work togeth	er seamlessly.
