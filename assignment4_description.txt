This animation depicts a beach scene. The sun slowly moves over the sky to depict daytime, after which the moon appears and also moves across the sky. When nighttime comes, the sky turns dark, the moon comes up, and stars appear in the sky. the day and night sequences alternate. The moon has a sub animation of becoming a crescent moon every other night cycle. The sun has a sub animation of having the rays alternate. The Fish and Shark classes include bubbles as their sub animation.The stars have a 10% chance of executing twinkle() which makes them yellow and star shaped. The stars are place randomly each time you run the program. Sun, Moon, and Star are all subclasses of the class Celestial_Bodies. Fish and Shark are subclasses of Animal. Shark objects move back and forth in one area of the sea, while fish swim from one end of the window to the other. The fish class includes two levels of hierarchical grouping: the fish moves across the window along a sinusoidal wave, while some bubbles behind it follow in a straight line, based on the position of the fish. Once the fish reaches the edge of the window, it appears back to its starting position and begins again. The animation should show all aspects within 30 seconds. The day night cycle continues in a loop.

Aparna: The project built on my picture for assignment 1, so the very basic features are my own - sky, sun, colors, etc. I worked on the display() methods for the Sun and Moon classes. I wrote the Point, Animals, Fish, and Star classes.

Daniel Hauser: I built the star, moon, and sun classes. I also did the display work in draw dealing with background fade and dynamic object generation using a map.
